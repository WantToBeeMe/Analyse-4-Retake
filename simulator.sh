# the assignment in a nutshel 
# this simulation will simule the Round Robin Algorithm        (note: quantum is a tiny time period)
# (each proces uses the CPU for a quantum and then its added to the back of the queue again, untill it has had enough quantums that its done) 
# when done, its execution time is then permanently removed from the scheduling 
#
# you will have several "fake processes" to schedule
# this program should decide when one of the "fake processes" needs to run
# each Ã«xecition"time for each quantum will be represented only from a printout (afther the print it will continue with the next running process)
#
# for example the following data
#      t = time in quantums
#     start t = time that the proces arives at cp (so when it should start (at witch queantum it should start))
#     execution t = the amount of quantums it takes for it to finish
#  Proces Name | Start t | execution t 
#      P1      |    0    |     4         #should start imidiatly, and take 4 quantums to finish
#      P2      |    1    |     2
#      P3      |    3    |     1         #should start at the 3th quantum, but finish imidiatly (because it only needs 1 quantum)

#
# q=1:  P2 is using the CPU
#       P1 is using the CPU

# q=3:  p3 is using the CPU
